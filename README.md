Scanning and face recognition process
The Fanzone application is designed to simplify the process for football fans to enter stadiums smoothly through official gates. We offer both a website and an iOS mobile application.
The primary goal of the project is to eliminate black market activities and prevent any illegal transactions outside official channels. Fans will first sign up on our website, and once the signup process is complete, they can book tickets , We have integrated with Paymob to handle and manage all payment processes. Upon booking a ticket, stadium entry involves two stages: first, the fan scans their ticket, and then they undergo face recognition to verify their identity. If the fan is not the verified owner of the ticket, entry will be denied.
We also developed an OCR model that allows fans to enter their SSN ID as a photo. The model verifies the validity of the ID and extracts the SSN number from it.
We used Firestore database to manage and store all fan-related data efficiently.
We have developed a prototype that includes a Raspberry Pi, camera, scanner, AVR microcontroller, and LCD. This setup is designed for scanning and conducting face recognition.
